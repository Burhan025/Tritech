# Tritech
In this project, I have customized Genesis-based WordPress themes with dynamic subpage headers, ACF, custom loops, and responsive layouts. Added WooCommerce support, optimized breadcrumbs, removed unused assets, repositioned navigation, enhanced UX, and integrated widgets. Created cleaner blog, single post, non-builder and other templates.
